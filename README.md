Human heart model developed at the Institute of Fluid Dynamics (IFD) at ETH Zurich. The model is based on LifeV (pronounced "life five"), a C++ parallel finite element library for the solution of PDEs.

The library is distributed under LGPL by CMCS – EPFL, E(CM)2 – Emory, MOX – Polimi, REO, ESTIME– INRIA. ([Copyright](https://github.com/lifev/lifev/blob/master/Copyright.md))
